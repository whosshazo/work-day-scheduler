Thus, changing the color of the time blocks linked in the css style page. The user will be able to distinguish where they are in the day by the colored time blocks. This page also allows the user to input any reminders for a specified time, and save them. If the user refreshes or leaves the page, the reminders will remain in their specified time blocks from the use of Local Storage.
